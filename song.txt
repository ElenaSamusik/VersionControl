What's the time?
Seems it's already morning.
I see the sky,
it's so beautiful and blue.
The TV's on but the only thing
showing is a picture of you.
Oh I get up and make myself some coffee.
I try to read a bit but the story's too thin.
I thank the Lord above that you're not here
to see me in the shape I'm in.

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too.

I'm spending my time
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please
Is there someone who can make me wake
up from this dream?
